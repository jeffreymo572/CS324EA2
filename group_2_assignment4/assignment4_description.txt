Our group split the 2d animation into 3 parts: background, middle ground, and foreground. Yawer was in charge of the background, Jeffrey was in charge of the middle ground, and Tarun was in charge of the foreground.

Here is the breakdown of the animation in each part:

	* Background (Yawer): The background has a sun and moon pair that alternate. The sun has triangles equidistant around its circumference that would rotate, and the sun and moon would translate along a Bezier curve in the sky. The color of the background also changes as they move across the sky using the "lerpcolor" function. A difficulty I had was to set up the lerpcolor to be a smooth transition between day, night, and sunrise. This is all controlled through the sun_moon Class. 

	* Middle ground (Jeffrey):

	* Foreground (Tarun):
